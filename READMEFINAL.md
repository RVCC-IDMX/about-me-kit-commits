# Netlify Status Badge: Building

# This “About Me” page is meant to demonstrate a technical skillset and offer a “neutral website template” that is preferred by employers. 
# This project offers a friendly and “no frills” template that showcases an ability to build and deploy websites on a quick time crunch. 
# While creating this website, I utilized responsive design for website and app layout and content organization. 
# This ensures usability needs are met across multiple screen sizes. 
# For this project, I refreshed my knowledge on how to manage a Github repository, consistently commit changes to Github with proper documentation, and deploy a site with Netlify. 
# For this project, I learned how to host, deploy, and maintain a live website in a way that is up to date with the web development standards of 2025. 
# As a developer's professional toolset and knowledge of programming languages expands and “stays sharp” by meeting people in the industry, attending conferences and events, and meeting with people within the Fortune 500, their web development skills and sense of professionalism will continue to improve as well. 
# The purpose of this website is to create something sharp, clean, and professional that can be shared within the web development “eco-system” to find paid projects and employment.
