                <p>
                    I enjoy spending time with my dog,
                    reading a variety of
                    books, and creating
                    drawings in my free time. I like to
                    read about
                    cybersecurity, just so I have a
                    “sense” of what the cyber landscape
                    that is surrounding our
                    lives is going to be
                    like over the next few years. I also
                    walk a certain number
                    of miles everyday,
                    based on some advice from a friend
                    of mine who is in the
                    U.S. Navy and has a
                    security clearance. I love watching
                    Phoebe Gate’s “the
                    burnouts” Podcast,
                    because it’s probably one of the
                    most unfiltered,
                    hysterical, and just real
                    Podcasts about what the intersection
                    of tech and business is
                    really like in this
                    day and age. I really enjoy learning
                    about which cleaning
                    supplies are best for
                    which surfaces. I do like deep
                    cleaning things. I know this
                    sounds “weird”, but
                    I was actually really excited to
                    take the fabric off of a
                    couch, vacuum the
                    inside, and start to do some repair
                    work. I also really
                    enjoy listening to
                    Q.104.3, the New York Classic Rock
                    Station, and WPRB, the
                    Princeton music
                    station on the way to class. I also
                    enjoy walks in the
                    woods, it just feels like
                    a calming place to be when “the lens
                    of technology gets to
                    be too much.”

                        I am beginning to
                        feel
                        this nocturnal existence tell on
                        me. It is destroying
                        my nerve. I start at my own
                        shadow, and am full of
                        all
                        sorts of horrible
                        imaginings. God knows that there
                        is ground for my
                        terrible fear in this
                        accursed place! I looked out
                        over the beautiful
                        expanse,
                        bathed in soft
                        yellow moonlight till it was
                        almost as light as day.

                <h2> About Me </h2>
                <!--Bio Section: Personal Info-->

                <p>I grew up around the Bell Labs area
                    in New Jersey. I’ve met a
                    really interesting
                    assortment of Physics PhD students,
                    mathematicians,
                    developers, and professional
                    designers over the years. I also
                    grew up around a lot of
                    people who worked on
                    technology projects that were funded
                    by the U.S. military
                    and I’ve worked on a
                    number of projects under NDA
                    agreements, and I have learned
                    the “real world”
                    version of working with clients. One
                    of the trends I’m
                    seeing in the
                    intersection of freelance developer
                    work and cybersecurity
                    work is an agreement
                    that sometimes you learn to be more
                    selective about what
                    clients you will and
                    will not work with not to be
                    “snobby” or “pretentious”, it’s
                    just that with the
                    way that the cyber landscape is
                    right now, you just have to
                    be careful to not
                    take on “just any client” for
                    financial reasons. It’s ok to
                    gradually learn how
                    to make work that has a more
                    widespread and commercial
                    appeal. There’s no shame
                    at all in starting to join projects,
                    companies, and teams
                    that are well funded.
                    There’s no shame in being a
                    developer who also looks at
                    stock patterns. Some
                    developers and designers have just
                    seen enough of the “well
                    that part of the
                    internet is on fire today, anyways…”
                    side of tech that
                    “we’re just kind of in it
                    for dog, lawn, immediate family
                    members, and some close
                    friends” at this point. </p>

                        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is
                        no longer a concept of
                        the future; it has seamlessly
                        integrated into our daily
                        routines. From virtual
                        assistants like Siri and Alexa
                        to
                        personalized recommendations on
                        streaming platforms, AI
                        is enhancing user experiences
                        across various domains.

                        in an office situation. It's a
                        really difficult balance
                        between leveraging AI for
                        productivity and ensuring data
                        privacy and security. Companies
                        are experimenting with
                        different policies to find the
                        best fit for their teams.

                        The way AI is going to be
                        utilized to fit teams together
                        based on neurotype is where it's
                        going to gets really
                        interesting. Although I do
                        wonder how much of that is
                        going to be based on actual
                        science versus just
                        marketing buzzwords.

                        As technology advances, so do
                        the threats to our digital
                        security. Cybersecurity has
                        become a paramount concern
                        for individuals and
                        organizations alike. From
                        phishing
                        attacks to ransomware, the
                        landscape of cyber threats is
                        constantly evolving. Staying
                        informed and adopting best
                        practices is crucial in
                        safeguarding sensitive
                        information.

                    <h3> Offices Can Use AI Without

                    <p>
                        So there's actually *nice* ways
                        in which AI can be used
                        in an office setting without
                        turning the workplace into
                        a surveillance state. AI can be
                        used to offer "soft
                        coaching", like nudging an
                        employee to take a break if
                        they've been working for too
                        long without a pause. It
                        can also help with scheduling by
                        suggesting optimal
                        times
                        for meetings based on team
                        members' availability and
                        productivity patterns. This can
                        be done without *spying
                        on
                        every aspect of an employee's
                        workday*.

                        An AI tool can be used to review

                        When used correctly, an AI tool

                        complementary tech skillsets.
                        For example, do you have a
                        front-end developer who is
                        proficient in React but lacks

                        with a back-end developer
                        who is proficient in Node.js.
                        Did your startup just pull

                    <p>
                        The z-index is a CSS property
                        that controls the vertical
                        stacking order of elements that
                        overlap on a web page.
                        It determines which elements
                        appear in front of or
                        behind others when they occupy
                        the same space. The
                        z-index is similar to layers in
                        photoshop. The higher
                        the
                        z-index,the closer to the viewer
                        the element appears.
                        The lower the z-index,the
                        further away from the
                        viewer the content appears.

                        These are the following reasons
                        why z-index is an
                        important job skill for web
                        developers and designers to

                        and image overlays.

                        If a developer does not
                        understand
                        stacking, these features will

                        Build better user experiences:
                        Understanding z-index.

                        1. The z-index allows developers
                        to create more
                        usable and visually appealing
                        interfaces by ensuring
                        that
                        important elements are always
                        visible and accessible.

                        2. Troubleshoot layout issues:
                        Developers who
                        understand z-index can quickly
                        identify and resolve
                        layout problems related to
                        overlapping elements.

                        3.The Z-index allows developers
                        to ship professional
                        quality UI/UX design work.

                        4. Understanding the z-index
                        will allow developers to
                        avoid common front end bugs.

                        that the z-index can help avoid
                        include:
